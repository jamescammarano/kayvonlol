          Welcome to the weird world of Kayvon Edson. Here we have a well-to-do
          white gay boy. He was proclaimed as infamous when he took his shoes
          off, clad in all black on the Boston Marathon finish line as he
          screamed, “Boston strong!” But there’s really more to the story than
          that. He made a deal with the devil. He gave his privilege away on a
          silver platter. Get ready to dance at the Disco Factory. You’re
          invited to a party that never ends with a fashion designer that
          believes in making an entrance.
